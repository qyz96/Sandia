/*! \ingroup API_Workers_Properties

\def STARPU_NMAXWORKERS
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Define the maximum number of workers managed by StarPU.

\def STARPU_MAXCPUS
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Define the maximum number of CPU workers managed by StarPU. The default value can be modified at
configure by using the option \ref enable-maxcpus "--enable-maxcpus".

\def STARPU_MAXNUMANODES
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Define the maximum number of NUMA nodes managed by StarPU. The default value can be modified at
configure by using the option \ref enable-maxnumanodes "--enable-maxnumanodes".

\def STARPU_MAXNODES
\ingroup API_Workers_Properties
Define the maximum number of memory nodes managed by StarPU. The default value can be modified at
configure by using the option \ref enable-maxnodes "--enable-maxnodes". Reducing it allows to
considerably reduce memory used by StarPU data structures.
